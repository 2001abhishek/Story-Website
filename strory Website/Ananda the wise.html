            <h3>ANANDA THE WISE</h3>
			<p> Years ago when things were calm, there lived a young
                woman who happens to be a prostitute named armarpali. Every kingdom she goes , the tide of lust hits the kingdom, kings were seduced, queens were jealous ,children were spoiled she got so rich that she could buy kingdoms for herself. Though this lust inflicting woman had a beautiful body Indeed  had a beautiful soul too.
                Despite having all the Gold and every eyes on her .She wanted love and respect from others .On one fine evening there arrived a group of monks led by buddha himself, all of them had a calm presence , an aura that is so quiet to feel . Through the window, armarpali gazed a
                Young monk who had charm like none other, a charm like  a river that hasn’t moved since a long time. Young
                monk’s name was Ananda. She approached him, talked
                with him and intention behind the arrival of monks was
                stay in the village for 4 months because of monsoon.
                Armarpali  in desperation asked Ananda to stay in her
                house for this monsoon. The wise ananda told her he
                will ask permission from his mentor buddha, “Master,
                There is an invitation I got ,there is a woman who wants
                To keep me in her house” without  a second thought
                buddha allowed him to stay in that dirty woman’s
                house. Shocked were others “how can a monk stay in a prostitute’s house    Buddha said he didn’t mentioned that woman as a prostitute, he respect her . The rain started so did her
                lust for young monk .She made food for him, she made
                bed for him, she danced for him and he paid close
                attention to her the entire time and the rains finally stops. Young ananda went back to buddha, every monk
                was amazed  because ananda brought a female monk
                with him.
