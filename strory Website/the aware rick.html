            <h3>THE *AWARE* RICK</h3>
			<p> Rick, a fine guy had a pretty decent life, he got a nice job which paid him enough. The job he really likes he was happy all the time without worrying about the future or past just living the live at finest, he was friendly, he was like the core of that group circle soon, there lived a girl Jessie in his neighbourhood who had fell in love with Rick, she talked with him, she foods for him & many more pleasant things she did but soon enough she realised rick doesn’t love her. In eyes of Rick, she was a nice pretty girl who was nice to him. Rick left the city for a while for some job-related issue. Back after 2 months that is when he wanted to see Jessie but she was no where to found and on one fine day he finally got the chance to talk with her. He smiled at her & waved a hello to her. They started talking soon Rick realised this is not the Jessie he remembered , she was less enthusiased Rick thought the fact “Why she was not nice for days-days became months finally it’s been a year since Rick talked Jessie , one day doing his  job at office he had this wild acknowledgement that “Actually she used to love me”. The very next day he went to see her Jessie came to talk. Rick told him that he is sorry for not realising her love, she smiled at him & walk away but from behind Rick got a man’s voice “Do I know you Mr?” Rick said “No but why”. “Well, you were talking to my wife.” Rick couldn’t believe what he heard.
