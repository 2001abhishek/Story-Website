            <h3>THE LONELY KING</h3>
			<pre>       There lived a king in his wealthy kingdom, where people
            respected him, even worshipped him. The almighty king
      helped many kingdoms that were to about collapse, 
       lend help in many villages that were on verge of death
      due to drought, maintained a strong sense of justice
      and had too much kindness for one man. After many
      years , there came a raging storm that destroyed 
      everything on its path. The great king was terrified, 
      afraid to lose faith that people had on him. Storm
      passed, many died, many houses were destroyed, crop
      were spoiled, children cried, women became widows, 
      men became helpless and then people started blaming 
      king for all of it. They said this is all omen that got us 
      because of the king, king was too good for others 
       no told him to be this good. They called him ‘ mad king’
      or ‘ insane king’ . Receiving the awful hate that shattered 
      the king’s heart. King left his kingdom and resided at a 
      lonely hill, all alone, broken , depressed . He thought his 
      majesty was not so great after all. Years later king decided to 
      return his kingdom, he saw the throne was still empty. 
      Whole kingdom was celebrating in joy like none other, 
      The good old king asked someone what’s the occasion. 
      He told king “ Years ago there lived a great 
      king and after a storm the king got mental sickness and 
      left the kingdom ….then after so many years he finally 
      returned to his rightful place.. yeah that’s the occasion”
