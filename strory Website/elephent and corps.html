            <h3>ELEPHANTS AND CORPSES</h3>
			<p> Kameron Hurley is a super influential writer most known for her magical work named God's War and Infidel. Elephants and Corpses, published in 2015, is the story of Nev and his assistant. Their role is in the buying of dead bodies. However, as with any such macabre job it brings unforeseen trouble. It's a journey of realisation, the realisation that some things are better left buried.
